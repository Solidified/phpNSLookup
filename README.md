# phpNSLookup
NSLookup / DIG domain lookup written using PHP

After spending several evenings searching the net for PHP code releated to
performing domain lookups, I decided to write something instead.

DSNGetRecord.php will display information returned from DNS<br>
(whether from your own server or another local DNS resolution source).

I am releasing this code based on the GPL V3 license.
You are free to use and modifiy my code, but please leave my
tag lines intact.

Enjoy the code and share your own here on GITHUB!
