# phpNSLookup
NSLookup / DIG domain lookup written using PHP

After spending several evenings searching the net for PHP code releated to
performing domain lookups,<br>I decided to write something instead.

DSNGetRecord.php will display information returned from DNS<br>
(whether from your own server or another local DNS resolution source).

I am releasing this code based on the GPL V3 license.<br>
You are free to use and modifiy my code,<br>
but please leave my tag lines intact.

Enjoy the code and share your own here on GITHUB!
